                                    The poems say an adventurer’s life is all open roads and the glory of coin
                                    and
                                    combat. The tales told in every farmhand-filled inn have to have some ring
                                    of
                                    truth to them, don’t they? The songs to inspire peasantry and royals

                                    soothe the savage beast or drive men to a frenzy—have to come from
                                    somewhere.

                                    to live it. Strap on your boots, noble orator. Sharpen that hidden dagger
                                    and
                                    take up the call. Someone’s got to be there, fighting shoulder-to-shoulder
                                    with
                                    the goons and the thugs and the soon-to-be-heroes. Who better than you to
                                    write
                                    the tale of your own heroism?

                                    The lands of Dungeon World are a gods-forsaken mess. They’re lousy with the
                                    walking dead, beasts of all sorts, and the vast unnatural spaces between
                                    safe
                                    and temple-blessed civilizations. It is a godless world out there. That’s
                                    why it
                                    needs you.

                                    Bringing the glory of your god to the heathens isn’t just in your
                                    nature—it’s
                                    your calling. It falls to you to proselytize with sword and mace and spell.
                                    To
                                    cleave deep into the witless heart of the wilds and plant the seed of
                                    divinity
                                    there. Some say that it is best to keep god close to your heart. You know
                                    that’s
                                    rubbish. God lives at the edge of a blade.

                    the list again and pick out the next most important move to your character, maybe something that
                    supports your first choice. Put your 15 in the stat for that move. Repeat this process for your

                        spell,
                        so that gets my 15. A 13 Wisdom will help me notice important details (and maybe keep my sanity,
                        based on the defy danger move). Charisma might be useful in dealing with summoned creatures so

                        put my 12 there. Living is always nice, so I put my 9 in Constitution for some extra HP.

                    When you perform a move in Dungeon World, you may be asked to roll in order to see how well you
                    performed. A move might say something like "roll +DEX" or "roll +CHA". Your modifiers are calculated
                    based on the stats your character has:

                    The front side of each character sheet lists the starting moves. Some classes, like the fighter,
                    have choices to make as part of one of their moves. Make these choices now. The wizard will need to
                    choose spells for their spellbook. Both the cleric and the wizard will need to choose which spells
                    they have prepared to start with.

                <p class="creation-details-italic">
                    A Summoning spell is an easy choice, so I take Contact Spirits. Magic Missile will allow me to deal
                    more damage than the pitiful d4 for the wizard class, so that’s in too. I choose Alarm for my last
                    spell, since I can think of some interesting uses for it.

                    Your alignment is a few words that describe your character’s moral outlook. Each class may only
                    start with certain alignments. Choose your alignment—in play, it’ll give your character certain

                <p class="creation-details-italic">
                    The Neutral option for wizards says I earn extra XP when I discover a magical mystery. Avon is all
                    about discovering mystery—I’ll go with Neutral.

                <p class="creation-details">
                    Each class has choices to make for starting gear. Keep your load in mind—it limits how much you can
                    easily carry. Make sure to total up your armor and note it on your character sheet.
                </p>
                <p class="creation-details-italic">
                    I’m worried about my HP, so I take armor over books. A dagger sounds about right for rituals; I
                    choose that over a staff. It’s a toss-up between the healing potion and the antitoxin, but healing
                    wins out. I also end up with some rations.

                    Introduce Your Character
                </h3>
                <p class="creation-details">
                    Now that you know who your character is, it’s time to introduce them to everyone else. Wait until
                    everyone’s finished choosing their name. Then go around the table; when it’s your turn, share your
                    look, class and anything else pertinent about your character. You can share your alignment now or
                    keep it a secret if you prefer.<br>
                    <br>
                    This is also the time for the GM to ask questions. The GM’s questions should help establish the
                    relationships between characters (“What do you think about that?”) and draw the group into the
                    adventure (“Does that mean you’ve met Grundloch before?”). The GM should listen to everything in the
                    description and ask about anything that stands out. Establish where they’re from, who they are, how
                    they came together, or anything else that seems relevant or interesting.
                </p>

                    “This is Avon, mighty wizard! He’s a human with haunted eyes, wild hair, strange robes, and a thin
                    body. Like I mentioned before his robes are strange because they’re literally not of this world:
                    they came to him as part of a summoning ritual.”

                    Choose Bonds
                </h3>
                <p class="creation-details">
                    Once everyone has described their characters you can choose your bonds. You must fill in one bond
                    but it’s in your best interest to fill in more. For each blank fill in the name of one character.
                    You can use the same character for more than one statement.<br>
                    <br>
                    Take some time to discuss the bonds and let the GM ask questions about them as they come up. You’ll
                    want to go back and forth and make sure everyone is happy and comfortable with how the bonds have
                    come out. Leave space to discover what each one might mean in play, too: don’t pre-determine
                    everything at the start. Once everyone’s filled in their bonds read them out to the group. When a
                    move has you roll+Bond you’ll count the number of bonds you have with the character in question and
                    add that to the roll.
                </p>
                <p class="creation-details-italic">
                    With everyone introduced I choose which character to list in each bond, I have Paul’s fighter Gregor
                    and Shannon’s cleric Brinton to choose from. The bond about prophecy sounds fun, so I choose Gregor
                    for it and end up with “Gregor will play an important role in the events to come. I have foreseen
                    it!” It seems like the wizard who contacts Things From Beyond and the cleric might not see eye to
                    eye, so I add Shannon’s character and get “Brinton is woefully misinformed about the world; I will
                    teach them all that I can.” I leave my last bond blank; I’ll deal with it later. Once everyone is
                    done I read my bonds aloud and we all discuss what this means about why we’re together and where
                    we’re going.
